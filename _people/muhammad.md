<p>My name is Muhammad Abid, I am a second year Mechatronic Systems Engineering (MSE) Student. As the Co-VP Events of MSESS, my responsibilty is to organize fun, interactive, and useful events that are vital in building the engineering culture at SFU. I like to organize collaborative events with other student societies, because it gives MSE students a chance to meet people from other disciplines. So far, I have been able to host events with Software Systems, Engineering Science, Computer Science, and Surrey Campus Committe. As well as, we've hosted several workshops to help students build their technical skills. I hope to keep hosting more events and workshops throughout the rest of the year. </p>

<p>I encourage everyone to come out to events to be held, interact with one another, and definitely do feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions at <a href="mailto:events@msess.ca">events@msess.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Stay blessed.</p>
